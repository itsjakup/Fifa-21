## Fifa-21 Project

This project leverages machine learning and data analysis techniques to explore and predict player performance in the FIFA 21 dataset. The dataset contains various player attributes such as skills, physical stats and more, which are analyzed to uncover insights into player quality, team performance, and career trajectory. By applying regression, classification, and clustering algorithms, the project aims to predict player ratings, identify key performance indicators, and group similar players. Additionally, advanced visualizations are used to present trends and patterns, such as the correlation between player attributes and overall ratings. The goal is to provide data-driven insights for team management, player scouting, and game strategy optimization.
